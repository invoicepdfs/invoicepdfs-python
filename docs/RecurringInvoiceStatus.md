# RecurringInvoiceStatus

`completed` is the schedule running out, not a failure — set by app/recurring/processor.py when the end date or occurrence count is reached. `RecurringInvoiceOut.status` was an unconstrained `str`, so this is the first time the set has been written down anywhere.

## Enum

* `ACTIVE` (value: `'active'`)

* `PAUSED` (value: `'paused'`)

* `CANCELLED` (value: `'cancelled'`)

* `COMPLETED` (value: `'completed'`)
