# ImportStatus

Three, not the five that were published. `confirm_import` does the work inside the request — \"For MVP, mark as completed immediately; future: background processing\" (app/api/v1/imports.py) — so nothing is ever `processing`, and nothing sets `failed`. They described a background path that was never built, the same way `render.*` events and `bounced` did.

## Enum

* `PENDING` (value: `'pending'`)

* `COMPLETED` (value: `'completed'`)

* `CANCELLED` (value: `'cancelled'`)
